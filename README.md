# Comparison
This repo compares AngularJS to jQuery.

The 2 pages that do the comparison are "jQueryDemo" and "angularJSDemo".
Things demonstrated are:
DOM manipulation in jQuery compared to built in directives in AngularJS.
jQuery's use of $ajax compared to angularJS's use of $http
jQuery's appending of a template compared to angularJS's ng-show something that is already on the dom but hidden from view.

There is another page called "angularJSplay" and it is a mess.
